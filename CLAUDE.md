## Architecture

Single binary with cobra subcommands. All code in `internal/` packages.

- `internal/models` — Session, SessionStatus, AgentType (claude, codex, opencode, gemini, crush, pi)
- `internal/config` — TOML config loading + saving
- `internal/tmux` — scanner (list-panes + /proc descendant walk), per-pane paths and worktree resolution, status detection (pane scraping)
- `internal/git` — resolves repository/worktree identity, reviews managed diffs, and pushes only an explicitly recorded clean branch
- `internal/state` — state files + session registry + session notes
- `internal/hooks` — hook handler (stdin JSON → state files → notifications)
- `internal/notifications` — delivery (toast/bell/os/popup) + persistent store
- `internal/picker` — Bubble Tea TUI (list/grid views, overlays, keybindings, mouse)
- `internal/notifs` — notification center TUI
- `internal/popup` — popup notification TUI
- `internal/session` — session creation + path resolution
- `internal/newsession` — new session + quick prototype forms
- `internal/attempts` — durable execution attempts (base SHA, branch, managed worktree, pane, lifecycle)
- `internal/orchestrator` — ticket worktree provisioning, delivery, reconciliation, diff review, idempotent GitHub PR creation, and conservative archive
- `internal/theme` — 13 themes on a derived design-token layer (see Themes), self-registering via init()
- `internal/setup` — status reporting + MCP + slash command installation for every agent
- `internal/mcp` — MCP server for inter-agent messaging, plus the CLI tool bridge
- `internal/bin` — shared binary finder
- `internal/fsutil` — atomic file writes
- `internal/log` — file logger (~/.local/share/nagare/nagare-go.log)

### Worktrees

Each agent pane resolves its own directory from `pane_current_path`, not the tmux
session path, so panes in different worktrees of one repo get their own path, branch,
and name (`{session}/{worktree}`). Worktree detection is structural — the git common
dir's parent differs from the toplevel — so hand-made worktrees work the same as
Claude Code's `.claude/worktrees/`.

Display-name precedence is: a window name the user set, then the worktree, then
`{agent}_NN`.

Worktree sessions are created by `session.CreateWorktree`. Claude Code has its own
`-w <name>` flag, so it is handed the flag and creates the worktree under
`.claude/worktrees/`; every other agent has no equivalent, so nagare runs
`git worktree add` into `.worktrees/` and opens the pane there. `--tmux` is never
passed to Claude — nagare already made the window.

A worktree pane always joins its repo's existing tmux session as a new window, which is
what lets the picker group them. Sessions are matched to a repo through
`git.MainRoot`, not by literal path, because a session's own directory is often a
worktree.

Because worktrees are windows in one session, Ctrl+x kills the *window* whenever a
session holds more than one agent pane — killing the session would take a repo's other
worktrees with it. On a worktree pane it then offers removal; `git.RemoveWorktree` never
passes `--force`, so git refuses while there is uncommitted work, and the branch is left
intact.

Worktree creation runs as a `tea.Cmd`, never inline: doing it in the update loop froze
the TUI for seconds. A spinner shows until the new agent pane appears in a scan
(`pendingWorktree.satisfiedBy`) rather than until nagare's own work returns, because
`claude -w` needs seconds more to build the worktree and start. Failures surface in the
status line instead of only reaching the log.

Removal is confirmed by a centred dialog (`renderConfirmOverlay`) drawn with
`placeOverlay`, like the help and theme overlays; only `y`/`n`/`esc` answer it. Claude
locks the worktrees it creates, so `git.RemoveWorktree` checks cleanliness itself,
unlocks, then removes without `--force` — passing `--force` would override the dirty
guard too.

The detail pane shows outstanding work (`git.WorkStatus`) and warns when two agents
share one directory. Work is cached per path and refreshed per scan: the pane
re-renders every frame for the status-dot pulse, so git must never be called from
render.

List rows show a colored one-cell agent sigil (`C` for Claude Code, `X` for Codex,
etc.) beside the name and the git branch in the right-hand column. Keeping both visible
matters when one tmux session mixes agents whose generated pane names look similar.
`branchFor` suppresses a branch that only repeats the row — Claude names a worktree's
branch `worktree-<name>` — checking the worktree name as well as the label, since a lone
pane in a worktree is labelled with its full `{session}/{worktree}` name.
`splitRowWidth` divides the row: the label takes what it needs but never squeezes the
branch below `minBranchWidth`.

In the list view, sessions sharing a tmux session name are grouped under a single
header row naming the repo, and children show only their own name — so the repo
prefix is not repeated on every row. Lone sessions also get a header and one indented
agent child, keeping the tree and agent sigils aligned across the list. One blank row
separates project blocks. A group takes the position of its most urgent member, so a
waiting worktree lifts its whole repo. Rows are derived per frame by
`picker.buildRows`; the cursor keeps indexing sessions, not rows. Grid view stays flat.

### Ticket orchestration

Enter opens the selected ticket's detail overlay, which is the board's reading
view: the card holds two lines, so a ready ticket was otherwise dispatched
unread. The overlay shows the description, repository, target branch, dates,
assignee with its live pane status, attempt ID, PR, and any submitted agent
report, and Enter there runs the ticket's one implied action — start an
isolated attempt from backlog or ready, jump to the agent pane while it runs.
The agent picker is drawn over the overlay rather than replacing it, so
cancelling with esc returns to the ticket. `syncDetail` re-reads the open
ticket on every board refresh and closes the overlay if the ticket is gone,
because the board reloads every second while an agent works.

The overlay windows its body by *rendered* rows: `detailField` truncates its
label rather than wrapping it — a wrapped label smuggles a newline into a row
the viewport counts as one — and `detailPage` budgets against a measured empty
box (`detailBox(nil)`), not against assumed border and padding arithmetic. The
hint bar reserves `esc close` and the scroll counter and trims only the
lane-specific hints.

`d` on a backlog or ready ticket selects an agent, then accepts an optional
per-session model. Blank input preserves the agent's configured default. Claude,
Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, pi, and OhMyPi receive `--model`; Crush skips model
selection because its CLI has no per-session model flag. The ticket must name a
repository and target branch. Nagare resolves the target to an immutable commit
without switching the source checkout, creates `nagare/<ticket>-<attempt>` under
`~/.local/share/nagare/workspaces/<attempt>/<repo>`, and starts every agent —
including Claude Code — inside that Nagare-created worktree.

The agent's tmux window is named after the ticket (`windowNameFor`), so the
picker shows `repo/new-video-compiler-template-3d7f13f1` rather than an opaque
pair of IDs. The attempt's short ID stays as a suffix: it is the one in the
branch name, so a pane still says which branch it is on, and two attempts on one
ticket would otherwise share a name that messaging resolves agents by.

Attempt records live independently under `~/.local/share/nagare/attempts/`.
They retain the base commit, branch, worktree, agent, selected model, session,
pane, errors, and submission time so retries do not overwrite provenance.
Ticket and attempt file updates use cross-process record locks because the board
and an agent MCP server can update the same record concurrently.

Provisioning never checks out or modifies the target branch. A failure after Git
creation deliberately leaves the branch and worktree intact. Reconciliation may
mark a missing running worktree failed and make its ticket retryable, but never
deletes anything.

`c` archives a done ticket's worktree once its agent pane has closed. The attempt
need not have been submitted: an agent that stops early never calls
`submit_ticket`, and its work is then finished, merged, and marked Done by hand —
a Done ticket is the human saying what a submitted attempt says, and it is the
more authoritative of the two. Without this such a ticket could never be closed
out, and removing its worktree by hand made reconciliation rewind the finished
ticket to Ready. Only an already archived or still provisioning attempt is
refused.

Archive verifies the path is below Nagare's managed root, verifies the repository,
and calls the existing non-force dirty-guarded removal, so uncommitted work still
blocks it. The attempt branch and its commits are always retained. A ticket with an active managed attempt cannot be
deleted.

### Submitting text to an agent

Typing into an agent TUI is not the same as submitting. Every agent debounces
its input: a burst of literal text is treated as a paste, and an Enter arriving
inside that window is appended to the buffer as a newline instead of submitting
it. The 50ms gap that used to separate the two `send-keys` calls was not enough,
and the failure is silent in the worst way — the ticket sits unsent in the
agent's prompt while the board reports the work handed off and the agent
running.

Worse, a pane running an agent is not an agent ready to be typed at. Claude
Code opens a directory it has not seen — which every managed worktree is — by
asking whether the folder is trusted, and waits there **indefinitely**, running
no hooks at all. Text typed at that dialog is discarded, and the Enter after it
answers the highlighted default, which is *No, exit*. The old blind send
therefore killed the agent it had just launched for the ticket, and the board
went on showing the ticket as running. Verified against a real pane, not
reasoned about.

`tmux.SubmitPrompt` therefore does two things. It types nothing until the agent
has reported itself through its hooks — which it cannot do while that dialog is
up, making the hook state the exact readiness signal — waiting up to a minute,
so answering the prompt lets delivery proceed on its own, and otherwise failing
with a message that names the trust prompt. Then it confirms the submit rather
than assuming it: Enter is resent — 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s — until the agent's own
state file changes, which is what accepting a prompt does (`UserPromptSubmit`
and its per-agent spellings).

`Submit.NotBefore` discards state older than the launch, because a pane keeps
the state files of every agent that has run in it and a previous occupant's
must not read as readiness. An agent that reports no state at all, which is
Crush (`models.ReportsStatus`), has nothing to wait for or confirm against and
keeps a single best-effort Enter rather than guessing at another TUI's input.
Both delivery paths use it: `mcp.sendNudge` for the mailbox notice and
`session.SendPromptToPane` for the orchestrator's direct fallback.

A stall is reported instead of swallowed, and the text is deliberately left in
the agent's prompt so it can be submitted by hand. Because the message file is
written before the notice is sent, `deliverWhenReady` stops retrying as soon as
an error contains `mcp.MessagePersistedMarker`: the wait exists for a pane that
has not registered itself yet, and resending after a save would duplicate the
ticket in the mailbox.

## Agent Integrations

Every agent reports status through one interface: `nagare-go hook-state` reading a JSON
object on stdin with `hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `cwd`, and optionally
`last_assistant_message` / `notification_type`, plus `TMUX_PANE` from the environment.
Agent-native event names are mapped to states centrally in `hooks.EventToState` — never
per-agent elsewhere.

| Agent | Status reporting | Messaging tools |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` | MCP (`~/.claude.json`) |
| Codex | hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json` | MCP (`~/.codex/config.toml`) |
| Gemini CLI | hooks in `~/.gemini/settings.json` | MCP (`~/.gemini/settings.json`) |
| OpenCode | plugin `~/.config/opencode/plugins/nagare.js` | MCP (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) |
| Crush | none | MCP (`~/.config/crush/crush.json`) |
| pi | extension `~/.pi/agent/extensions/nagare.ts` | `nagare-go tool` bridge (pi has no MCP) |

### Message identity is the agent instance

A message records `from_agent_id` / `to_agent_id`: the session ID the agent
reports through its hooks, read from the pane's state file at send time.
Matching prefers it, because neither of the weaker identities is an agent:

- A **pane** outlives the agent that ran in it. Keying outgoing state on the
  pane handed the next occupant the previous agent's outbox and every reply to
  it — observed in the wild across two unrelated repositories, delivered
  silently, with an action item for a checkout the receiver did not have.
- A **display name** is reused across repositories and months, and it
  legitimately changes for one agent as panes are added or a window is renamed.

The old filter *substituted* the pane check for the name check, so it was wrong
in both directions: a new occupant inherited another agent's messages, and an
agent whose pane was renumbered (a tmux server restart renumbers from `%0`)
silently lost its own. Identity now degrades rather than substitutes:
`Message.sentBy` / `addressedTo` take the agent ID when both sides have one,
else the pane *plus* the display-name root, else the name. The root is the tmux
session, which names the repository; only the suffix moves during a rename.

Records written before agent IDs existed have only the weaker identities, so a
name reused long enough after the fact can still match. `check_messages` caps
responses at the ten most recent for that reason.

pi has no MCP client by design, so its extension registers the five nagare tools and
shells out to `nagare-go tool <name> <json>`, which calls the same handlers the MCP
server calls. pi also has no permission prompts, so pi sessions never reach
`waiting_input`.

Codex writes command hooks with Claude Code's wire format — the same stdin JSON, the
same `hook_event_name` spellings — so `hooks.EventToState` needed nothing new. What
differs is everything around them, and each difference was verified against the
binary rather than assumed:

- Hooks live in their own `~/.codex/hooks.json`, not in a settings file, keyed
  `{"hooks": {"<Event>": [{"hooks": [handler]}]}}`.
- The per-hook timeout key is `timeout`, in seconds. Codex *reports* it back as
  `timeoutSec` over its app-server protocol but ignores that spelling in the file,
  with no warning — a hook written that way silently inherits the 600s default.
- Codex has no `Notification` or `Elicitation` event, so `PermissionRequest` is the
  only signal for a waiting prompt, and it fires once.
- An event whose value is `null` makes Codex reject the **entire** file
  ("invalid type: null, expected a sequence") and run none of the hooks in it.
  So an event nagare stops installing must be *deleted* from `hooks.json`, not
  filtered to nothing — a Go nil slice marshals as `null`. `pruneNagareHooks`
  owns that, and it repairs a file an earlier run already broke.
- A new or changed hook is **untrusted** and does not run until the user approves it
  in Codex's startup review (or `/hooks`). Setup says so, because hooks that look
  installed and never fire read as a nagare bug. Do not reach for
  `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` to paper over it.
- MCP servers live in `config.toml`, so `registerMCPCodex` edits TOML as text rather
  than round-tripping a map: that file is hand-written and holds comments and
  `[projects."..."]` tables. Only `[mcp_servers.nagare]` and its sub-tables are
  rewritten.
- Codex has no user-level slash commands, so it gets the Agent Skill Crush gets, at
  `~/.codex/skills/nagare/SKILL.md` — with the front matter Codex requires.
- `codex` has no `-c`; continuing is `codex resume --last`, which skips the picker.

Generated plugin/extension files are rewritten on every `nagare-go setup`, so edits
belong in `internal/setup`, not in the installed files.

Codex requires newly installed command hooks to be reviewed once with `/hooks`.
Nagare also installs a Codex Agent Skill at `~/.codex/skills/nagare/SKILL.md`.

## Picker Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Type | Fuzzy search sessions |
| Enter | Jump to selected session |
| Esc | Quit |
| ↑/↓ | Navigate |
| Tab | Toggle list/grid view |
| Ctrl+y | Approve permission |
| Ctrl+a | Approve always |
| Ctrl+f | Toggle star |
| Ctrl+o | Cycle sort mode |
| Ctrl+w | Unload agent pane |
| Ctrl+x | Kill the pane's window (or the session if it is the only agent pane); offers to remove a worktree |
| F2 | Name the selected task |
| F3 | New git worktree for this repo |
| F5 | Edit session note |
| Ctrl+n | New session form |
| Ctrl+r | Quick prototype |
| Ctrl+l | Inline prompt |
| Ctrl+g | Editor prompt ($EDITOR) |
| Ctrl+e | Edit config |
| Ctrl+t | Theme picker |
| Ctrl+b | Mailbox viewer |
| F4 | Jump to the next session waiting on you |
| F1 | Help overlay |

F4 walks the queue: forward from the cursor and wrapping, so repeated presses reach
every waiting session once before repeating. Most-urgent-first would ping-pong
between the same two. Only `waiting_input` counts — offering to jump to a running
agent would train the reflex to interrupt work in progress. It reports "nothing is
waiting" rather than doing nothing silently, and the footer names the queue size,
because three waiting is a different situation from one.

Mouse (`picker.mouse`, default on): click a session to select it, click it again to
jump, wheel to move the selection, click outside the help or theme overlay to close
it. A single click never jumps, so a stray click cannot abandon the picker; modal
dialogs (worktree removal, inline prompt) ignore clicks and want a deliberate answer.

The footer shows only the keys valid for the current mode and selection, trimmed to
one line — the full set is on F1. `hintsFor` lists hints in drop order, so whatever
matters most for the selection survives on a narrow terminal.

### Layout: measure, never assume

Every layout bug found so far has been the same bug — a rendered height or width
derived by arithmetic or by counting string lines, instead of measured with
`lipgloss.Height` / `lipgloss.Width` after wrapping. It is worth stating as a rule
because the failures are invisible: each of the four TUIs clamps its assembled
frame as a safety net, so an over-budget layout does not smear the screen, it
silently loses its bottom row — which is where hint bars and panel borders live.

Two habits follow from it:

1. **Wrap, then measure.** `lipgloss.Height(style.Width(w).Render(s))`, not
   `strings.Count(s, "\n") + 1`. A single string line occupies several rows once
   it is too long for its panel.
2. **Window by rows, not by items.** A list entry may be two rows, or three when
   it wraps. Treating a row budget as an item count over-renders by whatever the
   average entry height is.

Found and fixed by an audit of all four TUIs:

| Where | Assumed | Symptom |
|---|---|---|
| `picker` list header | header is 4 rows | stats line wraps; last rows pushed through the bottom border |
| `picker` help overlay | box is `height*2/3` | ~44 rows of content silently clipped; also pinned the entry animation to y=0 |
| `picker` grid card | header is 2 rows | card one row too tall; **bottom border clipped off** |
| `picker` grid rows | clamp height, keep row count | grid taller than the frame; lower cards cut off |
| `picker` grid card width | `Padding(1)` is 4 cells | separator two cells short |
| `picker` detail panel | `strings.Count("\n")` | narrow panel loses its bottom border |
| `popup` | `height - 7`, `width - 4` | hint bar clipped below ~70 cols; separators short |
| `popup` hint bar | padding floored at 1 | bar wider than the popup, wrapped, then clipped |
| `notifs` list | row budget as item count | 92 rows into a 50-row frame; hint bar never visible |
| `notifs` settings | `height` ignored entirely | overflowed any terminal under ~19 rows |
| `notifs` hint bar | trimmed from the end | dropped "Esc Quit", leaving no visible way out |
| `newsession`, `quickproto` | no frame clamp at all | huh lays out at ~98 cells; every row wrapped on narrower terminals |

A hint bar's exit key is reserved space and never trimmed — the picker footer keeps
`F1 More · Esc Quit`, the notification centre keeps `Esc Quit`. Trimming from the
end takes the way out with it.

Layout tests assert on the **unclamped** frame (`m.view()`, not `m.View()`), since
the clamp is what hides the overflow. `internal/popup/layout_test.go`,
`internal/notifs/layout_test.go` and the box-integrity tests in
`internal/picker/grid_test.go` all check exact frame size across a spread of
terminal sizes, plus that hint bars survive and boxes are closed.

### Activity sparklines

The picker showed what every agent was doing *now* and nothing about what it had
been doing — and those are different questions. An agent grinding for ten minutes
and one that woke up four seconds ago are identical in a list of status dots, and
which is which changes what you do about it.

Each scan appends one sample per session to `Model.history`, so the trace costs
nothing beyond the polling already happening. `internal/picker/spark.go` renders it
as braille: a cell is 2x4 dots, so two samples wide and four levels tall per
character. Nothing else in Unicode is that dense, and unlike the image protocols it
needs no capability negotiation and no tmux passthrough — it is just text.

Status maps to bar height with waiting *above* running, so the tallest bars are the
moments the user was needed, and each cell takes the louder of its two samples: one
moment of waiting inside a long run of work is the thing worth seeing, not something
to average away. Colour repeats the status colours, so the trace reads without a
legend. Shown in the detail pane as a `Recent` row and pinned right of each grid
card's header.

History is trimmed to `sparkSamples` and sessions that disappear are pruned, since
the picker runs for hours.

### Grid cards

Card height arithmetic must be *measured*, never assumed. Three bugs came from
assuming it:

- `previewHeight = cellHeight - 7` assumed the header block was exactly two rows.
  A long path plus a long branch wraps the meta line to a third, making the card a
  row taller than its cell — and `fitBox`'s `MaxHeight` then clipped that row,
  taking the bottom border with it. The card rendered with no bottom edge.
- `cellHeight` was clamped *up* to a minimum without reducing how many rows were
  drawn, so on a short terminal the grid was taller than the frame and the lower
  cards were silently cut off by the clamp in `View`. It now shows fewer rows and
  scrolls to keep the selected card visible, like the list view.
- `innerWidth = cellWidth - 6` over-subtracted: `Padding(1)` is one cell per side,
  so two, not four. The separator fell two cells short of its card.

A card's header is budgeted against the **text column** beside the agent art, not
the full card width. Sizing it against the card and then rendering it into the
narrower column is what wrapped the header — a latent bug that only surfaced once
the sparkline made the header wide enough to hit it. `gridModel` in the tests seeds
activity history for exactly that reason, so the 50-case card test covers the path.

The header is kept to one row by truncating the name, as list rows do; the meta
line may wrap and the preview budget is derived from its measured height. If even
one row of preview will not fit, the header block is clamped by *rendered rows* —
clamping string lines does not work, because one line can occupy several rows.

`TestGridCardsAreClosedBoxes` checks all four corners of every card across five
terminal sizes, five session counts and both content shapes; the frame-size test
covers the arithmetic feeding through to the whole frame.

### Animation

Four animations, on two clocks — one transient at 30fps for motion, one slow at
10fps for anything continuous.

**Overlay entry** rises into place on a harmonica spring (`internal/picker/anim.go`),
~233ms over 8 frames at 30fps, transient. Off with `picker.animations = false`. The
spring stops as soon as its offset *rounds* to zero — a terminal has no sub-cell
vertical positioning, so stepping past that point re-renders identical frames; the
first tuning wasted 6 such frames out of 18.

**Status-dot breath** (`breathStep`/`breathFactor`) walks a running or waiting dot's
colour toward the surface behind it and back, over 2.2s at 10fps on a cosine-eased
curve. It replaced a `Faint` toggle flipping once a second, which read as a blink:
two states, and an instant transition between them.

**Row flash** (`internal/picker/flash.go`) tints a row for 900ms when a session
starts waiting (toward Warning) or finishes working (toward Success), fading on a
front-loaded curve so it arrives bright and lets go gently. It fires on exactly the
two transitions the notification layer fires on, and never on first sight of a
session — otherwise every waiting agent flashes the moment the picker opens. Grid
cards flash their *border* rather than their fill: a card is large enough that
tinting all of it would shout, and its border already carries focus.

**Selection slide** (`selectionSlide` in `anim.go`) crossfades the row tint between
the row the cursor left and the one it arrived at — 130ms, four frames on the
transient clock, the two tints always summing to a whole so the highlight neither
dims nor doubles mid-move. It is the only animation that fires on ordinary use, and
that is the point: an overlay spring is invisible to anyone who never opens an
overlay. It is skipped when the list length changed (a refilter renumbers rows, so
the previous index no longer refers to the same session), in grid view (selection
there is a card border, which does not crossfade legibly), and while an overlay has
the screen.

**Nothing about a grid card animates.** Three attempts were made and all three were
rejected on looks: a staggered arrival when the grid is first shown, a dimming border
trail on the card being left behind, and a border flash when a card's agent changed
state. A card is a large object, and moving or lighting one pulls the eye to the card
rather than to what is written on it — a row is thin enough that motion reads as a
hint, a card is not. Do not re-add any of them.

The status dot inside a card still breathes; that is the only moving part in grid
view. `TestGridCardsDoNotAnimate` holds the breath phase still and asserts the frame
is byte-identical over three seconds of animation ticks, with a slide and flashes
forced on. It starts the slide directly rather than through a key press, because
`startSlide` refuses in grid view and going through it left the render side untested
— the first version of the test passed with a card trail re-added.

**Colour is the only thing a terminal can fade.** There is no opacity, so an effect
that would dissolve in a GUI has to walk its colour toward the background instead —
which is why `theme.Mix` is exported and why both the breath and the flash are
colour interpolations rather than character or position tricks.

**Slow animation is cheap; fast animation is not.** A 2.2s breath needs nothing like
30 samples to look continuous, because the colour moves so little between frames. At
10fps a 30-session frame is ~3% of a core, so the breath and the flash share one
10fps clock — and it stops itself entirely when no session is breathing and no row
is fading, so a settled list costs nothing. The scan handler restarts it, since a
clock that stops has to be woken by whatever makes it relevant again. That balance
is the whole reason the earlier "no always-on animation" conclusion was wrong: the
constraint was never the frame cost alone, it was frame cost times sample rate.

The animation clock only runs while something is moving, and that is not
negotiable: a frame costs **1.8–5.4 ms** to assemble (measured — 1.8ms at 8
sessions/120x30, 4.3ms at 30 sessions/200x50, 5.4ms in grid view), so a continuous
30fps clock would burn 5–15% of a core for as long as the picker is open. Eight
transient frames cost ~32ms. This is why the status-dot pulse stays a 1Hz Faint
toggle instead of breathing smoothly, and why any future always-on animation needs
the render path made cheaper first.

Those figures are after one optimisation pass; `internal/picker/bench_test.go`
keeps them measurable. What that pass did, and what is left:

- `fadingRule` wrote one `Style.Render` per cell. Render re-measures its input with
  full grapheme segmentation, which for a one-cell string is pure overhead, and a
  rule can be 200 cells wide several times a frame. It now emits SGR directly via
  `fgSeq`. Help overlay: 1.89ms → 1.30ms.
- `renderNameWithMatches` rendered per *rune*. It now batches into runs, since a
  fuzzy match is a handful of runs, not a rune-length list. Filtered list: 4.97ms →
  3.84ms.
- Row segments were each wrapped in a second `Render` purely to carry the row
  background — nine calls a row. Each segment now sets its own background, and the
  row is plain concatenation.
- The whole-frame `MaxWidth`/`MaxHeight` clamp in `View` was 18% of a frame by
  itself. Only the height half survives (`clampHeight`, which needs no
  measurement); width is established where content is built and asserted by
  `TestFrameIsExactlyTerminalSized`.

Net: **4.69ms → 3.39ms** at 30 sessions on 200x50, 6.60ms → 4.71ms in grid view,
4.97ms → 2.98ms filtered. Still not enough for an always-on 30fps clock at 30
sessions (10% of a core). The remaining cost is structural: `Style.Render` is 60%
of a frame and `stringWidth` 41%, nearly all of it the per-panel `fitBox` Render
measuring an entire panel to pin it. Going further means composing panels manually
— padding each line to width and drawing borders ourselves — which is a much larger
and riskier change than any of the above.

Verify a rendering change did not alter output before trusting a speedup:
`frameFingerprint` in `render_test.go` hashes the *cell attributes* of a frame
(character plus every colour and style in effect), so it is insensitive to how the
escape sequences are arranged but catches any visible difference. Both of the first
two optimisations above were confirmed cell-identical that way; the third was not,
and the difference turned out to be a latent bug it exposed — the selected row's
tint broke either side of the name, because the name and branch were rendered
without the row background and `onPlane` then filled the gap with the panel surface
instead. Fixed by giving every segment the row background explicitly.

Overlay entry is started centrally, by `Update` noticing that no overlay was open
before a keypress and one is open after, so a new overlay cannot forget to animate.
`overlayRect` and `placeOverlay` both take the animated offset, so a click lands on
the dialog where it currently appears rather than where it will rest.

### Help overlay

Two columns, sized to its content and capped to the frame, not to a fraction of the
terminal. The single-column version ran to ~44 rows: it overflowed the box on any
shorter terminal and was silently clipped, and because an oversized dialog's
centered position clamps to y=0 it also defeated the entry animation.
`TestHelpOverlayCoversEveryBinding` checks every constant in `keys.go` is
documented, since the footer defers to this screen.

## State Files

Compatible with Python version. Same paths, same JSON schema:
- `~/.local/share/nagare/states/*.json`
- `~/.local/share/nagare/sessions.json`
- `~/.local/share/nagare/notes.json` (session notes; kept out of sessions.json so Python nagare does not wipe the registry)
- `~/.local/share/nagare/notifications.json`
- `~/.local/share/nagare/tickets/*.json`
- `~/.local/share/nagare/attempts/*.json`
- `~/.local/share/nagare/workspaces/<attempt>/<repo>/` (managed linked worktrees, not state files)

## Themes

13 themes with light/dark support: tokyonight (default), aura, catppuccin, dracula,
flexoki, gruvbox, kanagawa, monokai, nord, onedark, onedarkpro, rosepine, vesper.

Styles are functions (not cached) — theme switches take effect immediately.

### Design tokens

`theme.Colors` is a token layer: every color is named for the *role* it plays, and
nothing outside `internal/theme` reaches for a raw hex value. Four groups —
surfaces, text, accents, status — documented on the struct.

A theme file declares only the palette it has an opinion about. `Register` runs
`normalize`, which derives the rest, so a new theme is four lines of hex rather than
fourteen and all 13 get the same sense of depth. An explicitly set token is never
overwritten.

Colors are `theme.Pair{Dark, Light}` rather than `compat.AdaptiveColor` so that
derivation can run *per mode*: elevating a surface means something different on a
`#1a1b26` canvas than on a `#d5d6db` one. `Pair` still satisfies `color.Color`, so
lipgloss consumes it directly.

Elevation steps HCL *lightness* rather than blending toward white, which is what
keeps a lifted tokyonight panel blue-grey instead of drifting to grey. The derived
values land within a few hex of the upstream palettes they imitate.

### Depth planes

Three planes, back to front, and choosing the wrong one is visible — a fill left on
the canvas plane inside a panel punches a hole straight through it:

| Token | Used for |
|-------|----------|
| `Background` | the canvas: the help bar and the gaps between grid cards |
| `Surface` | **every** panel and everything inside one, so a panel reads as one lifted slab |
| `Overlay` | dialogs, plus `Shadow` for what they cast |

**Every panel gets `Surface` — including the preview.** Two other planes were tried
for the preview well and both were wrong: a sunken `Recessed` tier to sell "a window
onto another terminal", then the canvas plane to put foreign ANSI back on the ground
the agent drew it against. Each argument is defensible in isolation and each looked
like a bug, because the preview sat directly below the detail panel in a different
color for a reason the eye cannot infer. Panels are panels. `Recessed` was removed
from `theme.Colors` rather than left unused.

Grid cards are uniform for the same reason: header, meta and preview all on the card
surface.

**Content entering a panel must be wrapped in `onPlane(content, plane)`.** A style
that sets only a foreground ends its run with a full SGR reset, which clears the
background for the rest of that line, and captured pane output is foreign ANSI that
resets whenever it likes. Both leave cells on the terminal's own background. That was
invisible while panels shared the terminal's background and became visible holes the
moment panels were lifted onto their own plane. Wrapping content in an outer
`Background` style is the bug, not the cure — the background has to be re-established
after each reset, which is what `onPlane` does. It keeps any background the content
brought with it, so a preview does not lose the agent's own highlighting.

Grid view is the exception worth remembering: it composes straight onto the canvas —
the cards *are* the panels — so its search bar and bottom padding must fill their own
rows, and `onPlane` must not be run over card rows or it would inject the canvas
inside them. `TestNoDefaultBackgroundCells` walks every cell of every view and fails
on any left on the default background.

Focus is carried by a gradient: `primaryPanelStyle` and the selected grid card use
`BorderForegroundBlend(GradientFrom, GradientTo)`, which sweeps the blend around the
border perimeter. Dialogs take the same gradient, which is what ties an overlay to
the panel it was summoned from.

Overlays are composited with lipgloss v2 `Layer`/`Compositor` (`placeOverlay`), not
by splicing strings: layers carry real Z-order — ground, backdrop, shadow, dialog —
and the same layer set can answer a mouse hit test later. `placeOverlay` clamps to
the width and height it was passed; the shadow clamps to whatever room is left, so a
dialog taller than the frame still casts to the side.

Not adopted, deliberately: styled (curly) underlines. lipgloss v2 emits a separate
SGR run per grapheme once one is set, which turned a 23-character status error into
958 bytes.
