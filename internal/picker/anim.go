// Overlay entry animation.
//
// A dialog rises into its resting place instead of appearing instantly. This is
// not decoration for its own sake: an overlay that pops in gives no clue where it
// came from or that it is a separate layer, while one that rises reads as having
// been summoned — the same reason the shadow under it helps.
//
// The clock only runs while something is actually moving. A frame costs 2-5ms to
// assemble at a realistic size (30 sessions, 200x50), so a continuous 30fps clock
// would burn 5-15% of a core for as long as the picker is open. Eight frames of
// settle costs nothing, which is why the status-dot pulse stays on its 1Hz
// toggle rather than being made to breathe smoothly.

	// Six is enough to read as movement; a longer slide reads as sluggish,

	overlayRise = 6.0
	// animRestVel is the speed below which the spring counts as stopped, once its
	// offset has rounded to zero. Both conditions matter: a terminal cannot show
	// sub-cell movement, so stepping past that point re-renders identical frames
	// — the first tuning of this ran 6 such frames, a fifth of the animation
	// spent invisible.

// The breathing clock.
//
// Status dots on running and waiting sessions breathe: their colour walks toward
// the panel behind them and back. A terminal has no opacity, so interpolating the
// colour is what a fade is here.
//
// It is deliberately slow, and that is what makes it affordable. A frame costs a
// few milliseconds to assemble, so a 30fps clock is out of the question — but a
// breath lasting a couple of seconds needs nothing like 30 samples to look smooth,
// because the colour moves so little between frames. At 10fps a 30-session frame
// costs about 3% of a core, and the motion still reads as continuous.
