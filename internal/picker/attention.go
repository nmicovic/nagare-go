// nextAttention returns the index of the next session that is waiting on the
// user, searching forward from `from` and wrapping around. It returns -1 when
// nothing is waiting.

// then walk every waiting session exactly once before coming back, which is what
// makes the key usable as "deal with the queue". Jumping to the most urgent one
// each time would bounce between the same two sessions forever.

// the user yet, and offering to jump there would train the reflex to interrupt
