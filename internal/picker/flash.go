// Row flash.
//
// When a session changes to a state that wants the user, its row briefly lights up
// and fades back. The picker already knows about these two moments — they are the
// same transitions the notification layer fires on — so this is the on-screen half
// of a signal that otherwise only existed as a toast the user may have missed.
//
// The point is peripheral vision. A status dot changing colour is easy to miss on a
// list of thirty; a row that pulses draws the eye to itself without the user having
// to be watching for it.
//
// It runs on the same slow clock as the breath, and only while something is
// actually fading, so a settled list costs nothing.

	// after glancing away, short enough not to sit there insisting.

	// colour at its peak. A row has to stay readable while it flashes, so this is a

	// flashBorderDepth is the equivalent for a grid card, where the flash goes on
	// the border rather than the fill. A card is large enough that tinting all of it

	// that up says the same thing quietly.
